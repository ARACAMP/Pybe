The Power of Plots


Pyber

The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, Pyber decided to join a fledgling ride sharing journey.

We used the company's complete recordset of ridescontains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Our objective was to build a [Bubble Plot] that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, we produced the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
